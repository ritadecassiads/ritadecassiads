ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rita!
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a Junior Full Stack Developer, focusing on Java, NestJS, and Angular.
ðŸ’¡ I love JavaScript and enjoy building useful and impactful applications.
ðŸ“š I have experience with Java Web, using the JavaServer Faces (JSF) specification, and Iâ€™ve also worked on projects with Node.js, React, Angular, and C#.

I believe that technology offers infinite possibilities, and I want to be part of this evolutionâ€”learning, innovating, and contributing to solutions that make people's lives easier. For me, programming is more than a job; it's a way to create real impact.
