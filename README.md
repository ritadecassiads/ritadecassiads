👋 Hi, I’m Rita!

🌱 I’m currently working as a Junior Full Stack Developer, focusing on Java, NestJS, and Angular. <br>
💡 I love JavaScript and enjoy building useful and impactful applications. <br>
📚 I have experience with Java Web, using the JavaServer Faces (JSF) specification, and I’ve also worked on projects with Node.js, React, Angular, and C#.

I believe that technology offers infinite possibilities, and I want to be part of this evolution—learning, innovating, and contributing to solutions that make people's lives easier. For me, programming is more than a job; it's a way to create real impact.
