- I believe that the world of technology is infinite in possibilities and in everything that will come to be. And I, as part of a generation of young people who are changing the way they live and see the world through technology, want and need to be part of this evolution, contributing with my willpower to learn and innovate with what can be done with technology. Programming goes beyond a job, it is also about directly impacting people's lives and making it more practical. I have been passionate about what I can develop by learning to program and I want to dedicate myself entirely to this purpose.
